  - Added **Session ID normalization**, prefixing `ses_` to satisfy strict OpenCode CLI validation.
  - Removed unsupported `--mode` and `--non-interactive` flags that caused CLI parsing errors.
- **Engine**: Optimized cold start behavior to skip redundant `stdin` injection for providers that handle the initial prompt via command-line arguments.

## [v0.8.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **Example Security**: Corrected invalid permission mode `bypass-permissions` to `bypassPermissions` in Go examples, fixing "session is dead" errors.
- **SDK Stability**: Fixed an unused variable in `go_opencode_lifecycle` example that prevented compilation.

### Changed
- **Example Optimization**: Updated Go and Node.js examples to demonstrate the new stateful `GetSessionStats(sessionID)` interface introduced in v0.8.0.

- **Bug Documentation**: Created a dedicated issue report for the OpenCode CLI startup bug in `docs/issues/` and tracked it in GitHub Issue #17.

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **OpenCode Provider Support**: Integrated `OpenCodeProvider` to support the OpenCode CLI ecosystem alongside Claude Code.
- **Dual-Protocol Proxy Server**: `hotplexd` now acts as a comprehensive proxy server supporting both native WebSocket and OpenCode-compatible HTTP/SSE protocols.
- **OpenCode HTTP API**: Implementation of `POST /session`, `GET /global/event` (SSE), and `POST /session/{id}/message` for seamless integration with OpenCode clients.
- **New Examples**: Added comprehensive Python and Go examples for the OpenCode provider and HTTP API.

### Changed
- **Server Package Refactoring**: Renamed and restructured server-related files (`hotplex_ws.go`, `opencode_http.go`, `security.go`) for better semantic clarity and maintainability.
- **Brand Normalization**: Unified project branding to lowercase `hotplex` across all documentation and visual assets.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Synchronized all documentation (README, AGENT.md, SDK Guide) and architecture maps with the latest codebase and dual-protocol features.
- **SDK Naming Correlation**: Aligned `ClientRequest`/`ServerResponse` JSON field names with the internal protocol for better consistency.

### Refactored
- **Internal Engine Types**: Renamed `TaskSystemPrompt` to `TaskInstructions` and moved Engine/Session options to internal packages to prevent circular dependencies.
- **Session ID Persistence**: Enhanced mapping of business identifiers to deterministic UUID v5 sessions.

## [v0.7.4] - 2026-02-22

## [v0.7.3] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Structured Prompting (XML + CDATA)**: Prompts are now encapsulated in `<task>` and `<user_input>` tags with CDATA protection to prevent parsing interference from complex inputs or code snippets.

### Changed
- **Conditional Prompt Construction**: When `TaskInstructions` is empty, the user prompt is passed as raw text, maintaining simplicity and directness for simple queries.

### Fixed
- **OpenCode Turn Detection**: Fixed `DetectTurnEnd` in `OpenCodeProvider` to properly handle `EventTypeResult`.
- **Provider Tests**: Updated and validated all provider-specific unit tests.

## [v0.7.2] - 2026-02-22

## [v0.6.1] - 2026-02-21

### Refactored
- **Code Quality**: Addressed gocyclo warnings for cyclomatic complexity > 15 by extracting logic and helper methods in `runner.go` (`executeWithMultiplex`, `dispatchCallback`) and `session_manager.go` (`startSession`).

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Visual Identity**: Completely revamped the `README.md` and `README_zh.md` with high-quality SVG architectures (`features.svg`, `topology.svg`, `async-stream.svg`) and unified badging for better developer experience and premium look.

## [v0.5.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Project Guidelines**: Added `CLAUDE.md` to provide standardized build, test, and lint instructions for AI-assisted development.

## [v0.5.1] - 2026-02-20

- **Documentation Localization**: Added a full English version of the architecture design document (`docs/architecture.md`) with cross-language navigation.
- **Unit Testing**: Added comprehensive unit tests for the `Danger Detector` (WAF) to verify security boundaries.

### Changed
- **Installation Docs**: Updated README to reflect Claude Code's native installation methods and official `go get` SDK integration.
- **Reference Syntax**: Standardized `AGENT.md` to use relative paths and updated reference syntax for better AI readability.
- **Architecture Files**: Renamed `architecture.md` to `architecture_zh.md` for the Chinese version.


## [v0.3.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Full-Lifecycle Examples**: Added comprehensive examples for both Go SDK (`full_sdk`) and WebSocket protocol (`full_websocket`), covering cold starts, hot-multiplexing, and session recovery.
- **Process Robustness**: Implemented `shutdownOnce` and enhanced `SIGKILL` logic to ensure clean termination of process groups (PGID).
- **GitHub Integration**: Official repository initialization and CI-ready structure.

### Changed
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Synchronized `architecture.md`, `README.md`, and `README_zh.md` to reflect the v0.2.0+ security posture (Native Tool Constraints).
- **WAF Refinement**: Updated `danger.go` to support context-aware interception and improved logging for security forensics.
- **Session Recovery**: Enhanced deterministic UUID v5 mapping to support seamless session resumption across engine restarts.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- **Security Posture Pivot**: Removed `ForbiddenPaths`, `GlobalAllowedPaths`, and `SessionAllowedPaths` from the SDK. Since HotPlex wraps a native binary (Claude CLI), it cannot reliably intercept raw OS syscalls mid-flight.
- **Native Tool Constraints**: Replaced path restrictions with native `--allowed-tools` and `--disallowed-tools` configurations.
- **Engine-Level Exclusivity**: Tool capabilities (`AllowedTools` / `DisallowedTools`) are now strictly defined on the `hotplex.EngineOptions` struct. `Config` no longer holds any capability boundaries, enforcing a single source of truth for Sandboxing.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Core Engine**: Implemented `hotplex.Engine` singleton for routing and process multiplexing.
- **Session Manager**: `SessionPool` functionality to manage long-lived OS processes with deterministic UUID mapping for Hot-Multiplexing.
- **WebSocket Gateway**: Standalone `hotplexd` server supporting persistent bi-directional streams over `ws://`.
- **Pre-flight Sandbox**: Introduced regex-based WAF (`danger.go`) to inherently block destructive shell commands (`rm -rf`, network shells, etc).
- **Security Boundaries**: Global static boundaries vs Per-session dynamic contexts cleanly separated between `EngineOptions` and `Config`.
- **Example Projects**: Provided Go native integration examples (`basic_sdk`) and pure JavaScript UI examples (`websocket_client`).

### Changed
- Refactored `Config` API: Migrated `Mode`, `PermissionMode`, `ForbiddenPaths` to global `EngineOptions` to prevent sandbox escape via API abuse.
- Streamlined Session identification to accept completely arbitrary context strings globally without breaking UUID persistence constraints.
