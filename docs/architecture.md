# hotplex Core Architecture Documentation

*Read this in other languages: [English](architecture.md), [简体中文](architecture_zh.md).*

hotplex is a high-performance **Agent Runtime** for AI CLI Agents, designed to transform one-off terminal-based AI tools (like Claude Code or OpenCode) into production-ready, long-lived interactive services. Its core philosophy is "Leverage vs Build"—by maintaining a persistent process pool with hardened security boundaries and a normalized full-duplex protocol layer, hotplex eliminates the spin-up overhead of headless CLI environments and enables millisecond-level responsiveness.

## 1. Physical Layout & Clean Architecture

hotplex follows a layered architecture with strict visibility rules, separating the public SDK from internal execution details and protocol adapters.

### 1.1 Directory Structure (Actual)
- **Root (`/`)**: Main entry point for the SDK. Contains `hotplex.go` (public aliases) and `client.go`.
- **`engine/`**: The public execution runner (`Engine`). Orchestrates prompt execution, security WAF, and event dispatching.
- **`provider/`**: The abstraction layer for diverse AI CLI agents. Contains the `Provider` interface and concrete implementations for `claude-code` and `opencode`.
- **`types/`**: Fundamental data structures (`Config`, `StreamMessage`, `UsageStats`).
- **`event/`**: Unified event protocol and callback definitions (`Callback`, `EventWithMeta`).
- **`chatapps/`**: **Platform Anti-Corruption Layer**. Connects HotPlex to social platforms (Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.).
  - `engine_handler.go`: Bridges platform messages to Engine commands.
  - `manager.go`: Lifecycle management for bot adapters.
  - `processor_*.go`: Middleware chain for message formatting, rate limiting, and thread management.
- **`internal/engine/`**: The core execution engine. Manages the `SessionPool` (process multiplexing) and `Session` (I/O piping and state management).
- **`internal/persistence/`**: Session durability markers and pool recovery logic.
- **`internal/security/`**: The Regex-based WAF (`Detector`) for command auditing.
- **`internal/config/`**: Hot-reloadable configuration watchers.
- **`internal/sys/`**: Low-level OS primitives for cross-platform process group management (PGID) and signal handling.
- **`internal/server/`**: Protocol adapters. Contains `hotplex_ws.go` (WebSocket) and `opencode_http.go` (REST/SSE).
- **`internal/strutil/`**: High-performance string manipulation and path cleaning.

### 1.2 Design Principles
1.  **Public Thin, Private Thick**: The root package `hotplex` provides a stable, minimal API surface.
2.  **Strategy Pattern (Provider)**: Decouples the engine from specific AI tools. `provider.Provider` allows switching backends without changing execution logic.
3.  **IO-Driven State Machine**: `internal/engine` manages process states (Starting, Ready, Busy, Dead) using IO markers rather than fixed sleeps.

## 2. Core System Components

### 2.1 Engine & Runner (`engine/runner.go`)
*   **Engine Singleton**: The primary interface for users (`NewEngine`, `Execute`).
*   **Security Injection**: Dynamically injects global `EngineOptions` (like `AllowedTools`) into downstream sessions.
*   **Deterministic Session ID**: Uses UUID v5 to map conversation IDs to persistent sessions, ensuring high context cache hits.

### 2.2 Provider Adapter (`provider/`)
Standardizes diverse CLI protocols into a unified "HotPlex Event Stream":
*   **Provider Interface**: Handles CLI argument construction, input payload formatting, and event parsing.
*   **Factory & Registry**: `ProviderFactory` manages provider instantiation, while `ProviderRegistry` caches active instances for reuse.

### 2.3 Session Manager (`internal/engine/pool.go`)
*   **Hot-Multiplexing**: The `SessionPool` maintains a registry of active processes. Repeat requests to the same session skip the "Cold Start" (fork) and perform a "Hot Execution" (stdin injection).
*   **Graceful GC**: Uses a `cleanupLoop` to sweep idle processes based on `IdleTimeout`.

### 2.4 Security & Process Isolation (`internal/security/`, `internal/sys/`)
*   **Regex WAF**: The `Detector` scans all input prompts for malicious intent (e.g., `rm -rf /`) as a final line of defense before reached the agent.
*   **PGID Hard Isolation**: Ensures that the agent and any of its child processes (e.g., a build script) are assigned a unique Process Group ID. Termination kills the entire group via `SIGKILL` to prevent orphan processes.

### 2.5 Event Hooks & Observability (`hooks/`, `telemetry/`)
*   **Webhooks & Audit**: Asynchronously broadcasts payload events to external systems (Slack, Webhooks) without blocking the hot-execution path.
*   **Tracing & Metrics**: Pushes native OpenTelemetry spans and exposes `/metrics` for Prometheus scraping.
